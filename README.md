# mastering-react-redux
These 4 projects helped me understand the concepts of React and how to implement Redux a state management system to store, manage and update data within the front end of an application.

I am now able to:
* Build modern user interfaces
* Use React lifecycle methods
* Create actions that gets handled in a reducer
* Connect React components to Redux and call action creators
* Pass and work with Redux state within React components
* Use axios to fetch JSON data from an API endpoint
* Use modern JavaScript and Higher-Order Functions & Arrays
